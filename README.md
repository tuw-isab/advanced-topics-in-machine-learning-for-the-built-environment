# Advanced Topics in Machine Learning for the Built Environment

This course explores advanced machine learning methods with a focus on their application to the built environment. It is designed for students and researchers with prior knowledge of machine learning who are interested in time series data, decision-making systems, and emerging AI models.

## Course Structure

The course is divided into four thematic blocks:

1. **Machine Learning for Time Series**
2. **Reinforcement Learning**
3. **Large Language Models**

Each block short theoretical inputs with hands-on coding sessions using Jupyter notebooks.

## Schedule

The sessions will take place on the following dates:

- **May 19** (09:00–15:00)
- **June 5** (09:00–15:00)
